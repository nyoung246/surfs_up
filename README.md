# Surfs Up

## Overview Of Analysis:

This analysis is to assist W.Avy in including more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. The data pulled and displayed were specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu. This data will be used to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. We achieved the temperatures by running two queries for each month, then storing them into a list, then displaying them in a dataframe. 

## Results: 
The photo shown below are the results for June.

The photo shown below are the results for December.

Three major points from the two analyses are as follows:

•	June had a higher average temperate of 74 degrees compared to December with the average temperate of 71 degrees. This tells us that the month of December if generally cooler than the month of June. 

•	June has a standard deviation of 3.26 while December had a standard deviation of 3.75. This may tell us that December had more rain compared to June.

•	Even though December had a higher standard deviation showing us that it received more rain, all of December’s percentiles are lower compared to June. 

## Summary:
Two additional queries that I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December are as follow:

•	We could include visual aids to assist us in analysing the weather in June and December. For example, a histogram can be used to show us how frequent a range of temperatures occur. And a line graph can be used to track the rainfall for each month.

•	We can also include all the other months to get a better picture of the precipitation and temperatures of the other seasons. From there, we may be able to track which seasons the surf shop may be busier or slower.
